NSFVis
======

Visual keyword search of NSF funding history written with R, Shiny, and ggplot2

NSFVis was developed using RStudio, with modules ggplot2, shiny, and RMySQL.  It takes the NSF Funding history database developed in NSF_History and generates histograms, for funding awards listed for up to three keywords, as a function of time.
